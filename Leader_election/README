This project implements a wave algorithm and a leader election algorithm in a 
distributed environment using MPI.
This is a school project that simulates a network in MPI. To run this project
you have to compile the program with 'make' and run with the following command
mpirun -np 12 ./tema4 test.in mesaje.in

This project has 3 big steps:
1. one node get the network configuration from an input file(here "test.in")
and send it to all the other nodes. This way every node with know the network
and will compute the shortest path from itself to all the other nodes.

2. The input file "mesaje.in" contains the messages to be send in the format:
source destination message.
This step the nodes exchange messages.

3. This step consists in a leader election algorithm. The nodes exchange
messages to choose a leader and a second leader based on a specific criteria
(here the leader will be the node with the least id)
