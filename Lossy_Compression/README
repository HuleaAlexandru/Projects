This school project implements a lossy compresion algorithm in Cell Broadband
Engine. Using DMA transfers, vector instructions and double buffering this
project optimize the serial program. In the 'info' directory there are plots
that shows the optimizations made by each technique.

The project was run on the university cluster following the next steps.
