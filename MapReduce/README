This project implements a MapReduce algorithm on a problem of similarities of
files. Given a set of files the program takes each 2 files and determines how
many words exists in both files. There are some tests which contains the sets
of files. Test1 contains the 1mb files, test2 contains the 10mb files and test3
contais the 5mb files.
To run the program you have to give 3 command line arguments:
number_of_threads input_test output_file
The output file will be the similarities of the files which are over a limit.
