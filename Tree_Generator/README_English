This project is a computer graphics project which consists in generating a tree, showing the the main steps in this process: the skeleton, the trunk, the whole tree - adding leaves. The project covers several computer graphics techniques like lightning(Blinn-Phong model) and texture mapping on 3D objects.
The projects also contains a camera and a light object and both can be moved by pressing some specific buttons.

Input:
Camera:
w,s - translation on oz axis
a,d - translation on ox axis
q,e - translation on oy axis

t,g - fps rotation on oz axis
f,h - fps rotation on ox axis
r,y - fps rotation on oy axis

i,k - tps rotation on oz axis
j,l - tps rotation on ox axis
u,o - tps rotation on oy axis

z - switch between steps - skeleton, trunk, tree
x - switch wireframe / not wireframe

Light:
8,2 - translation on oz axis
4,6 - translation on ox axis
7,9 - translation on oy axis
